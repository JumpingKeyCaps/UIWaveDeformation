## üöÄ Project Overview

This mini-project explores applying a **realistic wave deformation effect** on a **Jetpack Compose UI** by combining graphical rendering and user interaction.

The main idea is to simulate a **ripple wave propagating over a 2D grid surface**, then successively apply this deformation on:  
- the grid itself,  
- a bitmap image placed on the grid,  
- a snapshot of the real Compose UI,  
while keeping a **fully interactive UI responsive** via a transparent overlay.

## üéØ Goals

- Implement a realistic wave deformation (ripple/distortion) on a 2D grid.  
- Apply this deformation progressively on more complex graphical content: bitmap, Compose UI snapshot.  
- Maintain UI interactivity with a **transparent interactive overlay** above the deformed rendering.  
- Support multiple simultaneous wave interactions triggered at different screen points.  
- Provide a clean and performant architecture compatible with Jetpack Compose.

## üß© Challenges

- **How to dynamically deform an entire Compose UI?**  
  Compose doesn‚Äôt natively allow transforming the whole composable tree as a single modifiable canvas in real-time.

- **Keeping UI responsiveness despite heavy graphical rendering (snapshot + deformation animations)?**  
  Running deformation animations on a static image without blocking or disabling the real UI layer.

- **Managing multiple independent wave animations triggered by user interactions fluidly and synchronized.**

- **Optimizing performance to avoid frame drops or excessive CPU usage.**

## üí° Approach

1. **Phase 1: Grid deformation**  
   - Draw a 2D grid inside a Compose Canvas.  
   - Apply wave deformation by dynamically transforming grid points using sinusoidal wave functions with damping.

2. **Phase 2: Bitmap deformation**  
   - Project a bitmap texture onto the deformed grid.  
   - The graphical deformation simulates a ‚Äúwater surface‚Äù distorting the image.

3. **Phase 3: Compose UI snapshot deformation**  
   - Capture a snapshot (bitmap) of the real Compose UI.  
   - Apply wave deformation on this snapshot.  
   - Render the deformed image as a background.

4. **Maintaining UI interactivity**  
   - Overlay a **transparent, fully interactive Compose UI** on top of the deformed canvas.  
   - This overlay captures touch/click inputs to trigger wave animations.  
   - The UI remains fully functional and responsive, with multiple waves triggered concurrently without blocking.

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

- Performance constraints on low-end devices with multiple simultaneous waves.  
- Snapshot capture latency depending on UI complexity.  
- No GPU/OpenGL acceleration yet for deformation calculations.  
- Potential to add extra optical effects (blur, reflection, refraction).  
- Adaptation for multi-screen and orientation changes.

## üß† Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to combine **complex graphical rendering and modern interactive UI** on Android Compose by cleverly using snapshots and layered UI overlays.

It opens the door to unique visual effects while maintaining smooth, responsive user experiences ‚Äî a common challenge in advanced UI/UX design.
